                                The only cookies in use on our site are for <strong>Google Analytics</strong>. Google Analytics 
                                is a web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how visitors engage 
                                with their website. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports 
                                about how visitors interact with their website so that they can improve it.

                                Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor 
                                interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about 
                                how visitors use our site. We then use the information to compile reports and to 
                                help us improve our site.

                                These cookies are used to store information, such as the time that the current

                                referred the visitor to the web page.

                                Google Analytics collects information anonymously. It reports website trends 
                                without identifying individual visitors. <strong>You can opt out of Google Analytics

  <p><br>We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.
