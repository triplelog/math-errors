# Sandbox2

Sandbox2 is a C++ security sandbox for Linux which can be used to run untrusted
programs or portions of programs in confined environments. The idea is that the
runtime environment is so restricted that security bugs such as buffer overflows
in the protected region cause no harm.

## Documentation

Detailed developer documentation is available on the Google Developers site for Sandboxed API under
[Sandbox2](https://developers.google.com/sandboxed-api/docs/sandbox2/overview).
